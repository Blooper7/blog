I write about random crap, I guess. Don't expect *too much* intelligent stuff here XD

I like programming, music, grilled cheese sandwiches, newspaper comics, and old 1900s cartoons (Tom and Jerry is my favorite)

I'll probably be writing a lot about programming concepts as well as music concepts.

Here's my favorite project so far: [Cyclone Hash Algorithm](https://blooper7.github.io/Cyclone-Hash)

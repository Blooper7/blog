## Introduction

Hello!

My name is Sam, AKA Blooper7

As of today, I'm a senior in high school, planning to go to college soon. In the future, I want to get a job in embedded systems engineering.

I don't really have much to say in terms of engineering, so I'll just leave one of the stupidest pieces of code my classmates and I ever wrote in my Python Programming II course:

```python
for wep in weapons.Weapon_list:
    if type(weapon)==weapons.Weapon.TYPES.WEAPON:
        player.weapon.weapon_atk=weapons.Weapon.weapon_base_atk
        player._weapon_list+=_weapons[wep]
        print(weapons[wep].weapon_atk)
```
*Yes, we regret this. Yes, we fixed it. No, we'll never do it again.*
